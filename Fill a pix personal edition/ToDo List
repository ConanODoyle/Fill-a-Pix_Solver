DiaPopup:
Add WindowListeners to accept "Enter" key as validation
Make error message text appear when attempt to press Enter while the fields aren't full
Reformat so it actually looks good. That way Joe the non-coder won't feel like like this thing is trash.

GUI:
Add "ButtonRefresh" method where a Square[][] or int[][] grid is processed to something Joe can see.
Design a scaling method so the buttonGrid will enlarge when Aunt Marge makes the window bigger to help with her eyesight
Add a sidepanel with options (Save a file! Import a file! Resize the thing!). Duh. Goes with scaling thing above.
	Save a file will come later...

NumberPopup:
Add KeyboardListener. Spacebar and backspace will be the "empty" square.

FilePopup:
Make error message text appear when attempt to press Enter and the file isn't where its supposed to be. On repeated failures, show
  extra message to clarify where file should be??

Solver:
Add an incremental solving thing. Arraylist of Commands, or something like that.
	To go with that, add "isHighlighted" to Square for that stuff. Make the GUI show it.
Make the GUI do something when the puzzle is ambiguous. Look for the "Ambiguous Puzzle" println in Solver to find out where to put it.
